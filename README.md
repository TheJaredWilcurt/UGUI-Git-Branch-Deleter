This is a GUI that allows you to easily delete branches from a Git repo.

As long as you can type `git --version` into your command line and it returns a version number you should be able to run this. It is cross platform, but relies on an existing installation of Git.

This was created as a real-world test for UGUI, the NW.js framework.
